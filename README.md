# Tictactoe Game in JS (with AI)

In this simple version of tictactoe game, you can play against the AI in three different modes:
- Easy: the AI generates random moves.
- Medium: the AI does someting that makes sense, but you can still win.
- Impossible: the result is a tie or a win for the AI.


The AI code is an adaptation of a java project from [Píldoras Informáticas](https://www.pildorasinformaticas.es/) to which I have added and refactored code to make it work better.
